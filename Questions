Reason for current job change?
From begining I knew i would leave. But since I was starting project from scratch I stayed till now. I completed my project before time and have no work as of now. 
No direction of where they are going. Work culture has become worse.

What do you mean by Work culture?
How people react to problems. Management changes its policies every now and then. They promise something else and than dont fulfill.

3 companies in 3 years any reason?
I genuinely feel, that decisions I took were right and I dont regret anything. I left deloitte because I wanted to learn and learn fast.
At that time, I was fresher and wanted to achieve all knowledge in one go. I left VizEperts because they started laying Offs. Even though I was not at all in risk.
But still, prevention is better than cure. I chose Swiggy of all the offers since they promised much more things than others, but after entering realized they were fake.

Why would yu join us if you already have an offer?
I am looking out for better opportunities. This time I need to settle down. I am getting engaged this august, before that I need to stop wandering from city to city and
take my final call.
